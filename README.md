### teamsnap_rb in IRB

```ruby
$ bundle exec rake console
> client_config = TeamSnap::Config.new(
>   client_id: "your_client_id_here",
>   client_secret: "ssshhhhhh!"
> )
> client = TeamSnap::Client.new("http://apiv3.teamsnap.com/", config: client_config)
=> # client object
> team = client.teams.search(:id => "your_team_id_here").first
=> # team object
```

You can also access the API via OAuth2, which is handled outside of this gem.
Simply pass the authorization token to access:

```ruby
$ bundle exec rake console
> client_config = TeamSnap::Config.new(
>   authorization: "authorization key here",
> )
> client = TeamSnap::Client.new("http://apiv3.teamsnap.com/", config: client_config)
=> # client object
> client.me.first.teams.inject({}){|a, t| a[t.name] = t.href; a }
=> {"Authorized User Team"=>"https://apiv3.teamsnap.com/teams/82308"}
```

In order to work on teamsnap_rb most effectively and efficiently, it'll he helpful
to have a TeamSnap account and teams so you can work with that data. You can
create a TeamSnap account [here](https://go.teamsnap.com) and you can then
authorize a client application using our [Cogsworth
service](https://auth.teamsnap.com).

With a client ID and secret in hand, you can begin interacting with the gem
using real data.
